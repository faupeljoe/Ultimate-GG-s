# Ultimate GGs
- I got this idea when I saw that people were "scamming" other Super Smash Bros. Ultimate players by playing a money match and not paying when they lost the match
- The apps purpose is to have both players commit to a money match by initially putting money down in the app. 
- The players then play a best of 3, best of 5, or a first to 10 and update who wins each match.
- The app won't move on to the next round unless both players input the same winner (to prevent someone from lying)
- The winner of the moneymatch will win the earnings that were placed initially and they can either cash out their money or keep it in their balance for future matches.
